This is one of my first projects. What the script does: it goes to a pastebin link that you'll provide and searches for text that you pasted on pastebin.com, then it executes anything that you typed to the pastebin textbox. It's like a blind injection of commands that is very primitive, but hard to detect (at least I think).
